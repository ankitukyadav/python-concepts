# Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains various Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.

## ðŸ“š What's Inside

### Basic Python Concepts
- **01_variables_and_data_types.py** - Introduction to Python data types and variables
- **02_control_structures.py** - If-else statements, loops, and control flow
- **03_functions_and_scope.py** - Function definitions, parameters, and scope
- **04_classes_and_objects.py** - Object-oriented programming concepts
- **05_file_handling_and_exceptions.py** - File operations and error handling

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankitukyadav/python-concepts.git
   cd python-concepts

Run any script:
bash
python basic_python_concepts/01_variables_and_data_types.py

## ðŸ“– Learning Objectives
Each script is designed to teach specific Python concepts:
- Data Types: Understanding integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.
- Control Flow: Making decisions and repeating actions in your code
- Functions: Creating reusable code blocks and understanding scope
- OOP: Classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation
- File Handling: Reading from and writing to files safely
- Error Handling: Managing exceptions gracefully
